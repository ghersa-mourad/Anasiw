# Anasiw (ⴰⵏⴰⵙⵉⵡ) : A keyboard for amazigh people.
We believe that Tamazight is an amazing language that deserves to be the main language for us. to make it so we need to be able to share knowledge and exchange in Tamazight.
For that we build this keyboard that combines the Four keyboard an Amazigh need in his daily writings. we will work together to make Four become two.

# features :
- Tamazight Tifinagh (Make it your best friend :) )
- Tamazight Latin
- Arabic keyboard
- Latin keyboard (Qwerty)

# Notes :
Anasiw is open because we care about your privacy. A closed keyboard can send anything you write, this is way we build our own and made it Open.
